This is a game I'm writing for people in Twitch chat to play.

The idea is that I (the Twitch broadcaster) will have a big mega corp. Chatters can start their own company and gain points for watching, chatting, subscribing, etc. They can use these points to hire manufacturers, sales people, researtchers, HR, corporate lawyers, etc. These employees grow their companies to earn more points. They can also hire corporate spies, and attempt to attack the broadcaster's company, to gain employees, points, market share, etc.
